ToDo for 3/10:

-Intercept text messages as they come in and add them to the database
-Fix how the place end time is later than the capture time
-Don't drop multiple text messages at one spot- either make this a "place" or
make a new symbol that indicates there are multiple text messages their, and allow
user to view them all
-Conversation page isn't getting populated when you click on a text message
